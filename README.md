Crate Companion is a web application used to quickly identify a band's most popular albums and tracks. While digging through my local Philadelphia record stores, I use this site to help determine which records i'd like to add to my collection. React is used as the frontend framework with Axios making network requests. The rest is JSX and CSS. Visually optimized for desktop and mobile viewing.
